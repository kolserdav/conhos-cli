# Getting started with the Container Hosting service

## Introduction

The **conhos** utility is an open source program that is the official client of the **Container Hosting** service.

## System requirements

To work with the utility, you will need to install **Node.js** version **20** and higher on your computer. Official Node.js download page: https://nodejs.org or use the **Node Version Manager** https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.

## Installation

Install **conhos** globally on the system:

```sh
npm i -g conhos
```

We check the installation with the command:

```sh
conhos -v
```

If the installation was successful, you will see the program version.

## Login

To interact with the service using the **conhos** utility, you must first log in through your browser.
To start the authorization procedure, run in the console:

```sh
conhos login
```

Then, in the browser window that opens, enter your credentials from the conhos.ru service, then you will see a message in the console about successful authorization.

To restrict access to your account through the utility from your computer by other people, you can encrypt the authorization token with a password.
To do this, run the **login** command with the **-с** flag

```sh
# Optional
conhos login -c
```

Additionally, you will need to enter the token encryption password, and in the future, each time you use the token, you will need to enter the encryption password.

## Project Initialization

To do this, in the console, go to the folder of the project that you want to run in the cloud:

```sh
cd /my/project/path
```

And run the command to initialize the new config:

```sh
conhos init
```

The program will ask you clarifying questions, allowing which it will be able to create a configuration file for you **conhos.yml**

To speed up the initialization process and create the base **conhos.yml** file, run the **init** command with the **-y** flag:

```sh
# Optional
conhos init -y
```

> More information about the configuration file can be found in [Configuration File](./ConfigFile.md)

## Launching a project in the cloud

After the configuration file is configured, you can upload the project files to the cloud and launch all the necessary services.
To do this, run the command:

```sh
conhos deploy
```
